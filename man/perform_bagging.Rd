\title{Perform Bagging for Regression Models}
\usage{
perform_bagging(y, X, fit_function, R)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Response vector with outcomes.}

\item{X}{Predictor matrix or data frame.}

\item{fit_function}{A function that fits a model and returns a list containing at least coefficients and fitted values.
This function must accept two arguments: y (response) and X (predictors).}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates to use in the bagging process.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `coefficients`: Averaged coefficients across all bootstrap samples.
  - `se_coefficients`: Standard errors of the averaged coefficients.
  - `t_values`: t-values computed from averaged coefficients and their standard errors.
  - `p_values`: p-values associated with the t-values.
  - `predictions`: Averaged predictions across all bootstrap samples.
  - `variable_importance`: Importance scores for each predictor, averaged across all samples.
}
\description{
This function implements a generic bagging procedure for regression models. It takes a dataset, repeatedly samples
from it with replacement, fits a model on each sample, and then averages the results to improve model stability and
accuracy. It computes averaged coefficients, standard errors, t-values, p-values, and variable importance scores.

\examples{
# Example usage with a linear model fitting function
data(mtcars)
fit_function <- function(y, X) {
  model <- lm(y ~ X)
  list(coefficients = coef(model), fitted_values = predict(model))
}
results <- perform_bagging(mtcars$mpg, mtcars[, -1], fit_function, R = 100)
print(results)
