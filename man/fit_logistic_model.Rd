\title{Logistic Regression Model Fitting with Summary Output}
\usage{
fit_logistic_model(X, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix or data frame of predictor variables, possibly including categorical variables.}

\item{y}{Binary response variable.}
}
\value{
A list containing model coefficients, standard errors, z-values, p-values,
        and model statistics such as null and residual deviance and AIC.
}
\description{
Fits a logistic regression model using the Newton-Raphson method. This function
supports both numerical and categorical variables by converting categorical variables
into dummy variables. It provides a summary similar to glm output in R.
}
\examples{
data(mtcars)
X <- mtcars[, c("hp", "wt")]
y <- as.numeric(mtcars$am == 1)
result <- logistic_reg(X, y)
print(result$summary)
}
