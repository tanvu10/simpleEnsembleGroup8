Title: Ensemble Methods for Statistical Learning
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Group 8
Maintainer: Group 8 <vu.huynh@stonybrook.edu>
Description: This package provides tools for building predictive models using various 
    ensemble methods. It supports linear and logistic regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, 
    and elastic net models. Users can apply these models to both binary and continuous response variables,
    and manage datasets with a high number of predictors. Additionally, the package includes options for 
    bagging to improve model robustness and a feature for pre-screening the most informative predictors. 
    It also supports combining different models for ensemble learning, thereby enhancing predictive performance.
